{"Implementation approach":"To address the primary needs for a scalable, user-friendly inventory tracking app tailored for hotel managers, we will utilize Flask for the web framework due to its simplicity and flexibility. For real-time updates, we'll integrate Socket.IO with Flask. The SQLite database will be used for storage, given its lightweight nature and ease of setup, which is suitable for small to medium-sized hotel operations. SQLAlchemy will serve as the ORM to interact with the database in a Pythonic way. For generating custom reports, we will use the Pandas library for data analysis and manipulation, and Matplotlib for visualizing the data in reports.","File list":["main.py","app.py","models.py","routes.py","forms.py","utils.py","templates/base.html","templates/dashboard.html","templates/item_management.html","templates/report.html","static/css/style.css","static/js/script.js"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class Application {\n        +Flask app\n        +SQLAlchemy db\n    }\n    class Item {\n        -int id\n        -String name\n        -int quantity\n        -float price\n        +add_item()\n        +remove_item()\n        +update_item()\n    }\n    class InventoryManager {\n        +List[Item] items\n        +add_item(Item item)\n        +remove_item(int id)\n        +update_item(int id, Item data)\n        +get_low_stock_items() List[Item]\n    }\n    class ReportGenerator {\n        +generate_report(List[Item] items)\n    }\n    Application --> Item\n    Application --> InventoryManager\n    InventoryManager --> Item\n    ReportGenerator --> Item\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as Application\n    participant IM as InventoryManager\n    participant I as Item\n    participant RG as ReportGenerator\n    A->>IM: add_item(Item)\n    IM->>I: add_item()\n    A->>IM: remove_item(int id)\n    IM->>I: remove_item()\n    A->>IM: update_item(int id, Item data)\n    IM->>I: update_item()\n    A->>IM: get_low_stock_items()\n    IM-->>A: return List[Item]\n    A->>RG: generate_report(List[Item])\n    RG-->>A: return report\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"Clarification needed on the extent of integration required with existing hotel management systems, and whether there's a specific protocol or API standard to follow for this integration."}
